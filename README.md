# portfolio
I created a portfolio of myself showcases some of my projects to date. It includes Home, Aobut, Projects, Contact pages along with the capability to add contacts from the /contacts page and view added contacts at the /contacts/add page. I tried to implement the contact for to send emails but unfortunately I couldn't get it to send emails. I tried to use colors that I think match my personality and implemented css accordingly. The home page is designed to be responsive.
